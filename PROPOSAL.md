<h1>Project Proposal -- Rohan Rodrigues</h1>

<h3>Computer Vision</h3>

<ol>
    <li>I would like to do a facial recognition project that uses Computer Vision and the OpenCV library to detect and draw an outline around a person's face. </li>
    <li> I have used the opencv framework for robotics in high school when trying to make our robot drive autonomously in the field. Since this was something that interested me, I would like to extend my knowledge with vision by working on facial recognition.</li>
    <li>OpenCV library: https://openframeworks.cc/documentation/ofxOpenCv/</li>
    <li> Timeline:
        <p>By the end of week 1, I will have experimented with the different image analysis filters in the openCV library and decided on a sequence of filters to use.</p>
        <p>By the end of week 2, I will have decided on the different thresholds for the HSV/RGB values.</p>
        <p>By the end of week 3, the program will be able to successfully detect a person's face.</p>
        <p>By the end of week 4, the program will be able to both detect a person's face and draw the outline around a person's face.</p>
    </li>
    <li>If I were to finish the project early, I could code a game that involves the person moving their head around. The game would use the face's X and Y coordinates and do something with it. </li>
    
</ol>
