 - **11/16/19** Researched the openFramework library
 - Decided to some type of facial recognition project
 - Wrote final project documentation
 
 - **11/20/19** Learned how to load and display an image
 - Learned how to process and display a webcam stream 
 
- **11/23/19** Wrote code to overlay text, images, and circles onto a black screen
  
- **12/2/19** Finalized the code to have balls move horizontally across the screen
- Wrote code so that a circle is drawn over the point that the mouse is hovering upon

- **12/3/19** Wrote code so that when the user hovers over the ball with a mouse, 
- Wrote code so that once a ball moves out of the right side of the screen, the game ends

- **12/5/19** Created a seperate project where I implemented the OpenCV API for facial recognition
 
- **12/7/19** Finally got the program to recognize faces and draw a white box around the face
- Was able to get the X and Y coordinate of the face along with the face's width and height
  
- **12/9/19** Added the facial recognition code to the ball game
- Changed the ball game code so that instead of a mouse moving over the screen to remove the balls, the user has to move their face to get rid of the balls
       
- **12/11/19** Fixed remaining glitches and moved code to the final project github repository
